**Rubric:** Epidemiology, prevalence","In 2018, in France, one in four to six couples consult a doctor for infertility after one year, i.e., almost a quarter of the population wanting a child, reflecting a real public health problem.
The factors influencing fertility are:
=== In Women ===
- Age: This is the main factor predicting fertility in women. The chances of pregnancy and live births decrease with age. This age-related reduction in fertility is due to a decrease in the quantity of follicles in the ovaries and a decline in oocyte quality.
- Overweight and especially obesity
=== In Men ===
- Age, but to a lesser degree than in women.
- Numerous lifestyle and environmental factors, such as smoking, cannabis use, exposure to pollution or heat, physical activity, and stress.
- Weight is an important factor, as there is evidence of a dose-response relationship between male Body Mass Index and male hypofertility.

**Item Parent:** Microcrystalline Arthropathies 
**Title:** Know How to Diagnose a Gout Attack and Identify Situations Requiring Specialist Advice 
**Description:** Terrain, Semiology, General Signs, Comorbidities, Hyperuricaemia 
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

**Diagnosing a Gout Attack**
Gout attacks usually begin in the lower limb, particularly the foot (MTP joint of the big toe, ankle, then ascending to the knee). Attacks resolve themselves or are shortened or blocked by treatment. They recur in the absence of hypouricemic treatment with a variable frequency of weeks, months, or years. Attacks often occur closer together. At this stage of acute attacks, the joints are normal between attacks. After several years, they may affect the upper limbs. Gout rarely affects the spine, hip, or shoulder.

The diagnosis of gout is based on:
- **Background:** Men over 35, menopausal women, long-term treatment with diuretics, organ transplants; the family context must be investigated because gout has a strong genetic component (usually a polygenic disease, rare mutations in juvenile gout).

- **Nutritional Deviations:** Excessive consumption of sugary drinks rich in fructose (even ",sugar-free,soft drinks,beer with or without alcohol (rich in guanine),"strong alcohols (whisky, cognac, etc.)",option_a,3

i) In the event of associated extracellular dehydration, additional NaCl intake (orally or with isotonic saline solution at 9 g/L, 0.5 to 1L/h).

ii) In cases of extracellular euvolaemia due to SIADH, hyponatremia may be corrected by fluid restriction alone. If the dilution disorder is very marked (very high OsmU), fluid restriction alone may be insufficient. In this case:

iii) Adding osmoles by administering urea orally (0.25 to 0.50 g/kg diluted in orange juice).

a) Beneficence: The principle of beneficence suggests that what is advantageous for a patient must be achieved. However, as the benefit/risk balance may be uncertain, the principle of beneficence must be supplemented by the principle of non-maleficence.

b) Non-Maleficence: The principle of non-maleficence refers to the duty not to harm patients. It presupposes that medical action is inherently good and medically validated, but as the benefit/risk balance may be uncertain, it must be supplemented by the principle of beneficence.

c) Autonomy: The principle of autonomy derives from seventeenth-century philosophy, prefiguring the Enlightenment. René Descartes asserted the sovereignty of the mind over the body as a condition of freedom. Autonomy is understood as the individual's freedom to decide on preferences through internal deliberation based on analytical capacity.

d) Justice: The principle of justice involves non-discrimination, universality, access to healthcare for all, and solidarity. It is a broad concept with a strong moral dimension based on respect for the individual but also presents ethical tensions. Debates may arise about limiting access to expensive treatments or responding to requests for collective solidarity.

e) Respect for Autonomy: The principle of respect for autonomy involves treating others according to what you consider their good, often disregarding their preferences.

The question should assess understanding of the main ideas, and the options should be clear, informative, and relevant.

In clinical practice, we sometimes experience the difficulty of providing information, particularly when faced with highly distressed patients, where the truth is difficult to tell and some patients are unable to bear it.","Some former doctors used to quote St Thomas to justify not informing a patient: ""Man prefers a lie to the truth. Man prefers a lie to the truth that enlightens."" But apart from exceptional cases, this type of approach is a thing of the past. We believe that every patient has the right to know, so that they can participate in the organization of their care pathway, but also so that they can organize their lives accordingly, in terms of both day-to-day aspects and fundamental choices.","The law gives this development an additional dimension by placing information and consent within a contractual framework designed to assess the quality of medical practice, particularly in the event of conflict. Questions of the quality and completeness of information are part of this framework.","However, a rare case should be mentioned: the wish not to know.
