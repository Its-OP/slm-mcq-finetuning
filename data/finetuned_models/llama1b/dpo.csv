Do not confuse thermal medicine with hydrotherapy (external use of any water, regardless of its physical or chemical composition) or thalassotherapy (use of seawater without systematic medical supervision; neither recognized nor reimbursed by Health Insurance) or Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine.","The waters used in thermal medicine are classified according to their temperature (thermality) and their chemical composition (minerality). The 'thermality' separates 'cold' waters (8 to 15°C, mainly for diuresis cures), 'mesothermal' waters (25 to 34°C, for prolonged baths), and 'hyperthermal' waters (inhalation, study, shower, bath). The 'mineralization' (presence of a predominant ion) is constant for each source and enables mineral waters to be classified as:","Mineral waters are unstable, losing their characteristics after a few hours, which is why it is necessary to take the water from the source ('griffon') and to carry out the treatment on site. Other thermal agents include thermal plankton, thermal gases (CO2, H2S), and mud (peloids).","The main types of cures are internal hydrotherapy based on drinking cures (taking 100 to 300 ml/day of thermal water) used in all resorts.

**Title:** Know the Indications and Differential Diagnoses of Spermatic Cord Torsion Imaging 
**Rubric:** Additional Examinations
- If the clinical picture strongly suggests cord torsion, further investigation is not indicated.
- A strong clinical suspicion of spermatic cord torsion may delay emergency surgical management if imaging is pursued.
- Testicular ultrasound with Doppler is crucial in cases of acute bursal disease, especially after 24 hours. The study is compared with the contralateral testicle. Diagnosis of spermatic cord torsion can be challenging. If there is doubt about the diagnosis, particularly with atypical symptoms (fever, inflammatory appearance of the bursa, age > 30 years), a frustrated form, or scrotal pain present for more than 24 hours, scrotal ultrasound can assist in guiding the diagnosis.
- In typical cases of tight spermatic cord torsion, testicular ultrasound with Doppler may show:
- The whirlpool sign in the inguinal region, indicating coiling of the spermatic vessels
- An ascending testicle with heterogeneous echostructure, hypoechoic, and changes in the orientation of its long axis
- Reduced or absent intra-testicular vascularization compared with the contralateral side
- Ultrasound is neither sensitive nor specific for diagnosing cord torsion.
- A normal Doppler examination does not rule out an episode of torsion.
- Testicular Doppler ultrasound can rule out hydatid torsion, necrosis or intratumoral hemorrhage, traumatic rupture of the albuginea, or inguino-scrotal hernia.
- If the diagnosis is suspected, surgical exploration without imaging is recommended initially.
- Orchi-epididymitis may mimic cord torsion on ultrasound.","If the clinical picture strongly suggests cord torsion, further investigation is not indicated.","A strong clinical suspicion of spermatic cord torsion may delay emergency surgical management if imaging is pursued.

**Item Parent:** Localized or generalized lower limb edema 
**Title:** Principles of Symptomatic Treatment of Edematous Syndromes 
**Description:** Guidelines for the use of different classes of diuretics","1. Restriction of sodium intake
   - Salt-restricted diet providing 2 to 4 g NaCl (i.e., 35 to 70 mmoles of sodium) 
   - In the absence of hyponatremia (intracellular hyperhydration), there should be no restriction of water intake.

2. Increased elimination of sodium
   - Henle loop diuretics have the most powerful natriuretic effect 
     - Furosemide and bumetanide are used in higher doses when renal function is impaired. 
     - The injectable form, particularly continuous infusion, allows greater natriuresis to be achieved when edema is major or resistant to oral treatment.

3. Distal-acting diuretics have a synergistic effect with loop diuretics: 
   - Spironolactone helps to avoid the hypokalemia induced by loop diuretics by having a synergistic effect on natriuresis. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment.
   - Amiloride also has a synergistic effect with loop diuretics. Contraindicated in severe renal impairment.

4. Thiazides have a synergistic effect on natriuresis. The combination of loop diuretic and hydrochlorothiazide is very effective, particularly in patients with cardiac insufficiency.","1. Restriction of sodium intake

Socially topical issues: sexuality, gender identity, filiation, and parenthood.

The body is a multidimensional object of study. This is why the humanities and social sciences have explored the human body in various ways. Whether approached through history, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, or literature, the body offers an abundance of possible approaches to its study.","Historical, social, cultural, and normative contextualization of representations of the body and its uses. Socially topical issues: sexuality, gender identity, filiation, and parenthood.

The choice of foods suited to human beings, the way we eat, physical exercise, gender assignment, the regulation of procreation, and aesthetic standards are all social constructions that adapt to cultural traditions and the natural environment. Eating helps reconstruct social logics and group identities. Dietary prohibitions in several religious traditions, health regimes linked to different life stages, particularly childhood and old age ('ageing well'), the impact of certain foods on the emotional and affective sphere, and the importance of gastronomy in social interactions place human food at the heart of a social, symbolic, and economic system with implications for representations of the body in a given place and time. For example, overweight, which in the Renaissance was synonymous with good health, gradually became a major public health problem from the 1960s-1970s onwards. This change began in the 16th century with the evolution of beauty codes, illustrated by clothing habits such as corseting. There are close links between aesthetics, the standards imposed by fashion, and body standards. This is also linked to the industrialization and urbanization of society, imposing a more sedentary lifestyle and leading to new consumer habits and a richer diet.","Historical, social, cultural, and normative contextualization of representations of the body and its uses. Socially topical issues: sexuality, gender identity, filiation, and parenthood.

For sociologists, notably Pierre Bourdieu, the body performs at least three functions: memory, learning class habits, and as a marker of social position. The body bears witness to inequalities between social classes, depending on eating habits or the type of work performed, which do not shape bodies in the same way.","Historical, social, cultural, and normative contextualization of representations of the body and its uses. Socially topical issues: sexuality, gender identity, filiation, and parenthood.

In addition to social differences, there are cultural differences. Voluntary transformations of the body, such as tattoos, piercings, and scarification, have different functions in different eras and societies. There are also differences in the production of bodily norms and rules depending on religion.","Historical, social, cultural, and normative contextualization of representations of the body and its uses. Socially topical issues: sexuality, gender identity, filiation, and parenthood.

This frequency decreases to 25% between 24 and 26 weeks' gestation, then increases again to reach 100% at the end of the pregnancy. If conception occurs after the rash, the risk of fetal infection is likely low, as the rash coincides with the appearance of antibodies and the end of viremia.","When maternal infection occurs before 11 weeks' gestation, the risk of major fetal anomalies is very high (around 90%). After 18 weeks' gestation, the risk is virtually nil. Between 11 and 18 weeks' gestation, the frequency of abnormalities varies.","There are two situations: **Polymalformative syndrome**: This includes neurological anomalies (microcephaly), ophthalmic anomalies (cataracts, microphthalmia, glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy, chorioretinitis), auditory anomalies (sensorineural deafness), and cardiac anomalies (stenosis of the peripheral pulmonary artery, persistence of the ductus arteriosus, or interventricular communication). It can be complicated by miscarriage or fetal death in utero. **Progressive congenital rubella**: This corresponds to chronic generalized viral infection, reflecting the persistence of the virus in the blood, which may persist for several months. These newborns are highly contagious. This form may be asymptomatic, particularly in the case of maternal infection after 18 weeks' gestation. When symptomatic, growth retardation, thrombocytopenic purpura, jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, convulsions, and radiological bone abnormalities may be observed.

If the initial serology is negative, the serology will be checked at 20 SA. Beyond that point, the fetal risk is so low that it no longer warrants monitoring.","If serology is positive in early pregnancy, this is usually due to immunity linked to a previous infection or vaccination. In the absence of any rash, contagion, or travel to a high-risk country, no further investigation is warranted. Conversely, if since the start of the pregnancy the patient reports: - A rash - Contact with a person who has shown symptoms compatible with rubella (rash, arthralgias) - A trip to a high-risk country (Africa/Asia) Biological tests in a reference laboratory are essential (IgM tests, as routine serology only includes IgG tests, and measurement of the IgG avidity index).

Item Parent: Prevention of fetal risks: infection, drugs, toxic substances, irradiation","Questioning is the key to screening. It should be intensified in the following clinical situations:
- History of FAS/malformative syndrome in the offspring (very high risk of recurrence)
- Drug addiction (30-50% of patients on drug substitutes drink alcohol)
- Context of domestic violence, sexual abuse
- Psychiatric disorders, depression
- Heavy smoking
- Ultrasound findings of growth retardation or malformations","It is important to adopt an empathetic attitude and a non-judgmental framework, preferring indirect and/or open-ended questions: ""Before pregnancy, how many drinks did you have a day? And now?"" or ""Is it difficult for you not to drink alcohol now?""

**Description:** Knowing How to Define/Recognize
**Rubric:** Definition

**Interaction:** Occurs when the association between an exposure and a health phenomenon varies according to the level of another factor, known as effect modification, called the interaction factor.
- The interaction factor must not be confused with a confounding factor: the presence of a confounding factor can produce (or amplify) the association under study even though it does not exist, or mask (or reduce) it when it does exist.
- To account for an interaction factor, we can perform:
  - A stratified analysis.
  - The introduction of an interaction term into a multivariate model.
- The interaction test is necessary to determine whether the effect is modified in a statistically significant way, i.e., whether there is a significant difference in the association between the levels of the interaction factor (the null hypothesis is the absence of interaction, the alternative hypothesis is the existence of an interaction).
- Example: Study evaluating the association between smoking and lung cancer (fictitious figures):

**Confounding Factor:**
- Men: RR = 2.67
- Women: RR = 2.05

Sex is a confounding factor here: when stratified by sex, the association between smoking and lung cancer decreases, but the estimated RR is approximately the same in each stratum.

**Interaction Factor:**
- Inhalation: RR = 2.43
- No Inhalation: RR = 1.20

The fact of inhaling smoke is an interaction factor here: the estimate of the association between smoking and lung cancer is not the same depending on whether or not the smoke is inhaled.

OIC-039-04-A,Which of the following techniques for preserving female fertility is NOT indicated in a patient who requires gonadotoxic treatment as a matter of extreme urgency?,"Freezing or storage of mature oocytes or embryos, which requires prior hormonal stimulation. As with IVF, the ovaries are stimulated with hormones, and an ultrasound-guided oocyte puncture is then performed vaginally. The mature oocytes recovered can either be frozen and stored at -196°C or used in fertilization for patients in couples who so wish, before freezing and storing the embryos.","Freezing and storage of mature oocytes without prior hormonal stimulation. This involves puncturing the immature oocytes contained in the small antral follicles without injecting any hormone. The recovered oocytes are then matured 'in vitro' in the laboratory for 24 to 48 hours. Only the oocytes that have matured are frozen or used for fertilization with a view to embryo freezing for patients in couples who so wish. This technique can be carried out as an emergency, regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle.","Ovarian cortex freezing or preservation involves removing part of an ovary or an entire ovary, usually during laparoscopy. The cortex, containing the stock of primordial follicles, is isolated and then cut into fragments which are then frozen at -196°C. For reuse, the fragments of ovarian cortex are grafted onto either the remaining ovary or the peritoneum. Autografting has the advantage of restoring endogenous hormone secretion as well as fertility. It has proved its effectiveness in humans, with more than 130 children born worldwide up to 2021 after an ovarian cortex autograft (spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies induced by IVF). The major risk of this transplant is, in the case of malignant pathologies, the 'reintroduction of the initial disease' through the tumor cells present in the ovarian fragments. To avoid this risk, other reuse procedures are being developed and are still in the field of research (in vitro follicular maturation in the laboratory using primordial follicles from the preserved ovarian cortex or alternative grafting procedures using previously isolated primordial ovarian follicles). In addition, injections of GnRH agonists aimed at 'resting' the ovaries (to protect the pool of primordial follicles from the effects of chemotherapy) may be proposed, even if this has not been shown to be effective.","In prepubescent girls, ovarian cortex freezing or conservation will be the only possible preservation technique.",option_c,4

**Educational Content**
**Item_parent:** Unusual acute and chronic headache in adults and children 
**Title:** Knowing the indication and relevance of imaging for acute and chronic headache in adults and children 
**Description:** None 
**Rubric:** Additional examinations

- **In practice:***
  - Any sudden headache should be investigated as an aneurysmal SAH.
  - Any progressive headache should be investigated as HTIC.
  - Any febrile headache should be investigated as meningitis.
  - Investigations are carried out in the emergency department, sometimes after the patient has been transferred to a center with the necessary imaging capabilities (angioscanner).

**1. Imaging for acute headache***
- Request for an imaging examination (SD-231); reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination (SD-178); discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination (SD-226)
- **Cerebral CT scan as a matter of urgency:** Any sudden headache should be investigated by a cerebral CT scan without injection to look for a SAH, whenever possible with a cerebral angioscan immediately.
- **In the presence of a visible SAH:** The search for an aneurysm indicates a cerebral angioscanner if this has not already been done.
- **In the absence of a visible SAH:** LP is imperative.
- If no SAH is found on CT scan or LP, the search for another cause must be discussed (specialist opinion), particularly if the headache persists, and is based on arterial (SVCR), venous (TVC), and SAH (dissection) angioscanner, followed by cerebral MRI (TVC, pituitary necrosis).
  - **ASD angioscan** must be performed for any suspected dissection (cervicalgia, Claude-Bernard-Horner, sudden headache without visible ASD).
- Imaging will be repeated a few days later (MRI+MRA or angioscan) in cases of suspected CRS with normal initial parenchymal and arterial imaging.
- After an angioscan and LP showing no aneurysmal SAH, cerebral arteriography via the femoral route is not useful.

**2. Imaging for acute progressive headache***
- Cerebral imaging is necessary in all cases, with a variable delay
  - Headache present or aggravated for < 7 days: emergency imaging.
  - Stable headache for > 7 days: delays to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
- A full brain MRI is ideally performed immediately (T1, FLAIR, injected T1, and vascular sequences) to look for an intracranial expansive process (mass, contrast) and signs of CVT. A T2* sequence may be requested to identify bleeding or a hyposignal CVT. A fat-sat sequence (fat saturation) and MRA of the ASD are required to detect a cervical arterial dissection.
- If access to MRI is limited, a brain scan without and then with injection of contrast medium and an angioscan of the ASD will be performed. If there is no diagnosis after the scan and the headache persists, an MRI scan should be performed to look for lesions that are not easily visible on the scan (CVT, PRES, pituitary necrosis, and intracranial hypotension).
- If imaging does not provide a definitive diagnosis and the headache persists, an LP should be discussed to look for meningitis or a CSF pressure disorder.

**3. Imaging for chronic headache (long-standing and habitual)**
Carry out a cerebral MRI scan (avoid non-emergency scans as they can cause radiation) only if there is a suspicion of a secondary headache and/or a neurological disease that can cause auras (other than migraine).
- Migraine attacks starting after the age of 50
- Atypical migraine aura because of abrupt onset, duration > 60 minutes, symptoms always on the same side, or absence of visual disturbance
- Chronic migraine for less than a year
- Chronic tension headache for less than a year
- Algie vasculaire de la face (AVF) at least once (rule out AVF secondary to damage to the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, or posterior fossa)
- Abnormal clinical examination

**Paediatric particularities:**
  - Request for a patient's explanation of the procedure, risks, and expected benefits of an imaging examination (SD-232)
  - The indication for brain imaging must be justified because: 
    - Brain MRI requires sedation or general anesthesia until the child is old enough to remain calm (7-8 years).
    - Radiation exposure in children must be kept to a minimum.
  - The indications for emergency brain imaging are: abnormal neurological examination; changes in headache; signs of HTIC; visual or oculomotor disorders; persistent or increasing frequency of vomiting; signs suggestive of hypothalamic-pituitary damage; delay or change in height.","Any sudden headache should be investigated as an aneurysmal SAH.

**Title:** Knowing the performance indicators of diagnostic tests 
**Description:** None 
**Rubric:** Definition 

**Sensitivity:** Proportion of subjects classified as ill (with a positive test result) out of all subjects actually suffering from the disease.

**Specificity:** Proportion of subjects classified as not ill (with a negative test result) out of all subjects not affected by the disease.

**Positive Predictive Value:** Proportion of sick subjects among those classified as sick (with a positive test result).

**Negative Predictive Value:** Proportion of non-diseased subjects among those classified as non-diseased (with a negative test result). 

**Calculation of the Sensitivity (Se), Specificity (Sp), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of a Diagnostic Test:""

- **Test Results:**
  - **Positive:**
    - True Positive (a)
    - False Positive (b)
    - PPV = a/(a + b)
  - **Negative:**

- **Formulas:""
  - Sensitivity (Se) = a/(a + c)
  - Specificity (Sp) = d/(b + d)

otionEvent: The correct answer is option A, which has the highest sensitivity and specificity. This indicates that the test is highly accurate in detecting positive results for infectious diseases.

Option B has the lowest sensitivity and specificity, indicating that it may not be as reliable in identifying positive results for infectious diseases.

Option C has a high false negative rate, meaning that it may miss some cases of disease when tested. This could lead to misdiagnosis or under-treatment of patients.

**Educational Content:**
**Item Parent:** Hypersensitivity and mucocutaneous allergies in children and adults. Urticaria, atopic and contact dermatitis

**Title:** Knowing the Factors Responsible for Atopy

**Description:** Genetic, Immunological, and Environmental Factors

**Definitions:""
Atopy is defined as a predisposing condition to abnormal IgE-mediated immunological reactivity to certain environmental antigens (allergens).
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common and earliest clinical manifestation associated with atopy. It is a complex polygenic disease involving two groups of genes: 
- Epidermal barrier genes (e.g., filaggrin gene)
- Genes regulating the adaptive and innate immune system
Environmental factors play a major role in the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis, but these have not yet been clearly identified. However, a number of favorable factors have been documented, such as exposure to cats in early childhood.

This is an example of a chronic subdural haematoma (SDH). Chronic SDHs are collections of blood that have been present for some time. They can be seen on imaging as exudates in the meningeal spaces between the arachnoid and dura, with fluid collection limited by the dural sinuses.

The crescent-moon appearance is a characteristic feature of chronic SDHs. The crescent shape is due to the fluid collection being confined within the dural sinuses, which are narrow structures that run along the inner surface of the dura mater. This limits the amount of fluid that can accumulate in the subdural space and causes the fluid to be more concentrated.

The hypodense appearance on cerebral X-ray is a characteristic feature of chronic SDHs. The presence of hypodensity indicates that there has been recent bleeding into the subdural space, which results in the accumulation of blood within the meningeal spaces. This can cause the fluid to be more concentrated and result in a hypodense appearance on imaging.

The mixture of hypodense and hyperdense areas is another characteristic feature of chronic SDHs. The presence of both hypodensity and hyperdensity indicates that there has been recent bleeding into the subdural space, which results in the accumulation of blood within the meningeal spaces. This can cause the fluid to be more concentrated and result in a mixture of hypodense and hyperdense areas on imaging.","Extraparenchymal collection with fluid content, sometimes associated with recent bleeding, usually crescent-shaped, limited by the dural sinuses, and quite often bilateral.

Auscultation is altered but not pathognomonic (systolic murmur for an aortic prosthesis or diastolic murmur for a prosthesis in the mitral position).

**Item Parent:** Surveillance of wearers of valvular prostheses 

**Title:** Know how to diagnose the removal of a prosthetic valve, including haemolysis 

**Definitions:""

There are two main causes of prosthesis deinsertion:
- Early onset: Loosening of the suture of the prosthesis or paravalvular leakage due to significant calcification.
- Medium- or long-term onset: Deleterious infective endocarditis, which should be systematically investigated.
The clinical picture varies, depending on the severity of the induced regurgitation and the speed at which it develops. Disinsertion may be completely asymptomatic or may progress to a state of cardiogenic shock.

**Physical Examination:**
- A regurgitant murmur is noted, diastolic at the aortic site for a prosthesis in the aortic position, and systolic at the mitral site for a prosthesis in the mitral position.

**Key Examinations:**
- The primary examination is Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE), generally supplemented by Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE).
- Colour Doppler can identify a paraprosthetic leak, i.e., a leak between the prosthesis and the native valve annulus.
- Ultrasound is used to quantify the leak and assess its impact, particularly on the left ventricle.

**Laboratory Tests:**
- Blood cultures should be taken systematically to avoid missing infective endocarditis.
- Biologically, there is generally a nonspecific inflammatory syndrome and sometimes haemolysis. In haemolysis, LDH is increased, and haptoglobin is reduced. The presence of schizocytes indicates the mechanical origin of the anaemia.

**Management:**
- If the deinsertion is moderate, stable, asymptomatic, and has no impact on the TTE, simple monitoring may suffice.
- In the event of complications, interventional or surgical management may be required.","The most common cause of prosthesis deinsertion in patients with a prosthetic valve is early onset. This can occur due to loosening of the suture of the prosthesis or paravalvular leakage due to significant calcification.

In contrast, long-term deinsertion may be caused by deleterious infective endocarditis, which should be systematically investigated.","The most common cause of prosthesis deinsertion in patients with a prosthetic valve is early onset.

Answer options must be as short as possible.","The presence of a prosthetic valve significantly increases the risk of infective endocarditis (IE). Patients with prosthetic heart valves are classified as having a high risk of infection, with the incidence of prosthesis-related IE estimated at around 5% at 5 years.

Early adverse events (AEs) occurring less than one year after implantation result from peri-operative contamination (e.g., catheter, urinary catheter, orotracheal intubation). The germs are mainly from the Staphylococcus family (Coagulase negative or Aureus).

Late infective endocarditis (IE) occurring more than one year after implantation originates from more common routes of entry for IEs (cutaneous, dental, digestive). The germs are similar to those found in AEs on native valves (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus).

Clinical monitoring of patients with valve prostheses is essential. The onset of fever associated with an unknown murmur should alert the clinician. Additionally, any prolonged fever without a warning sign should prompt a search for infective endocarditis.
The diagnostic strategy for adverse reactions (ARs) on prosthetic valves is identical to that for native valves.

Antibiotic treatment is the same as for AEs involving native valves.
The indications for surgery are discussed on a case-by-case basis, with the following conditions being particularly favorable: clinically significant prosthesis dysfunction, uncontrolled infectious syndrome despite antibiotic therapy, presence of an abscess or fistula, and IE caused by Staphylococcus Aureus.

Prevention of AEs for prosthesis wearers depends primarily on clear information being provided to the patient. It is also essential to provide the patient with a valve prosthesis wearer card.

Therapeutic education is crucial, particularly regarding signs that should prompt consultation (e.g., prolonged fever, general malaise).

The diagnostic strategy for adverse reactions (ARs) on prosthetic valves is identical to that for native valves.

Antibiotic treatment is the same as for AEs involving native valves.
The indications for surgery are discussed on a case-by-case basis, with the following conditions being particularly favorable: clinically significant prosthesis dysfunction, uncontrolled infectious syndrome despite antibiotic therapy, presence of an abscess or fistula, and IE caused by Staphylococcus Aureus.

Prevention of AEs for prosthesis wearers depends primarily on clear information being provided to the patient. It is also essential to provide the patient with a valve prosthesis wearer card.

Therapeutic education is crucial, particularly regarding signs that should prompt consultation (e.g., prolonged fever, general malaise). Blood cultures should be taken systematically before any antibiotic treatment.",3

- If the risk is less than 1/1000, simple pregnancy monitoring is recommended.
- If the risk is between 1/51 and 1/1000, non-invasive prenatal screening (test on free foetal DNA circulating in maternal blood, DPNI) is proposed. 
If the DPNI is negative: continuation of the usual ultrasound monitoring of the pregnancy.

- If the DPNI is positive: proposal of a foetal karyotype. The FISH test has a very good positive and negative predictive value, but does not allow a definite diagnosis of trisomy 21 to be made. Therefore, no termination of pregnancy will be carried out on the basis of a positive result from an NIPD test.

- If it has not been possible to carry out screening in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, it is possible to propose the measurement of serum markers in the 2nd trimester (hCG, alpha-feto-protein, oestriol).","The combined test includes a measurement of nuchal translucency in the 1st trimester and serum markers in the 1st trimester.

Aging alters the perception and expression of pain, especially if there is cognitive impairment. Pain is often underestimated and undertreated, and treatment must be individualized and adapted according to the patient's health status, including comorbidities and chronic treatments.","Certain acute conditions that are typically painful in adults, such as myocardial infarction, visceral pain, ulcers, and fractures, can be ""silent"" in the elderly. They often present late at the emergency department and report their pain later than younger adults, leading to more complications that can be serious or even fatal.","The prevalence of chronic pain is high, affecting between 40% and 80% of people living at home or in institutions. It has various aetiologies, including osteoarticular, muscular, neuropathic, and iatrogenic causes.","Pain management is based on four pillars: Spotting, Evaluation, Treatment, and Revaluation.

Spotting
- Some types of pain are predictable, such as pain during care or pressure sores, while others are more difficult to anticipate, like paroxysmal attacks of pain. It is important to look for warning signs and have a pain reflex, especially if the behavior is abnormal, such as agitation or screaming. Any elderly person expressing pain or behavior suggestive of pain should be considered in pain, and the precautionary principle should be applied.

Evaluation
- The patient should be correctly seated, with an empathetic and patient approach, fostering a climate of trust while considering any cognitive or expressive difficulties. A geriatric assessment, including depression and behavior, is conducted alongside identifying pain components. Self-assessment is done using a simple numerical or verbal scale. If this fails, an observation of behaviors using a hetero-evaluation scale (e.g., Algoplus®, Doloplus®, ECPA®) is used, preferably in a team, and repeated regularly.

Treatment
- Aging modifies the pharmacology of drugs, including analgesics. The same analgesics and co-analgesics used by younger adults are used, but adverse effects and contraindications are more numerous due to comorbidities and polymedication. Clinical pharmacists can help screen for drug-related iatrogenia and assist in drug reconciliation. Mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pain often coexist in the elderly. Before prescribing analgesics, the patient's health, drug treatment, renal function, weight, nutritional status, cognitive and emotional state, social situation, and compliance must be assessed. Dosage adjustments are recommended, with dosages increased slowly, and renal function monitored. Potential adverse effects and interactions of added analgesics are anticipated and avoided, but pain should not be undertreated for fear of adverse effects.

Revaluation
- Always reassess to adapt and prioritize treatments to reduce multi-medication and optimize the benefit-risk balance. An elderly patient who does not complain can still be in pain.",option_d,4

**Item Parent:** Spondyloarthritis 
**Title:** Knowing the Rational Use of Biological and Imaging Examinations 
**Description:** CRP, HLA B27 
**Rubric:** Complementary Examinations 

**Conventional Radiography**
X-rays of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine from the front and in profile, and of the pelvis from the front, as well as X-rays of painful areas, are necessary.
- Enthesophyte: Cicatricial ossification along a peripheral enthesis (the calcaneal spur is the best known). This lesion is not specific to spondyloarthritis and can be seen in mechanical overstress.
- Syndesmophyte: Ossification of a vertebral enthesis. Specific to spondyloarthritis. Differs from an osteophyte in that it is fine rather than coarse, and in its vertical direction. It forms slowly and may result in the fusion of two vertebrae.
**Other Imaging Techniques**
In the case of sacroiliitis on standard radiography, MRI of the sacroiliac joint and spine is of no diagnostic value. MRI of the sacroiliac joints (or even the spine) may be useful in cases of diagnostic doubt. Ultrasound and scintigraphy are rarely used for diagnostic purposes.
**Other Complementary Examinations**
- CRP or SV: 60% of patients with untreated spondyloarthritis do not have elevated CRP or SV. However, a significant rise in CRP should prompt a search for an associated tumor or infectious disease.
- Testing for HLA B27: Useful for diagnosis in doubtful cases.

**Title:** Antidiabetics (metformin, sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors): mechanisms of action, indications, side effects, drug interactions, monitoring procedures, and main causes of failure.

**Description:** Knowing the mechanisms of action.","Metformin: Inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, increase in peripheral glucose uptake (muscles).",Sulfonylurea: Stimulation of insulin release by the pancreas.,"Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) Inhibitors: Inhibition of the degradation of incretins by DPP-4, allowing incretins to stimulate insulin release and inhibit the release of glucagon by the pancreas. The mechanism of action is glucose-dependent, meaning DPP-4 inhibitors do not stimulate insulin release when blood glucose levels are low.","GLP-1 Agonists: An analogue of an incretin (GLP-1) that is resistant to DPP-4, enabling it to stimulate the release of insulin and inhibit the release of glucagon from the pancreas.","DPP-4 Inhibitors: Inhibition of the degradation of incretins by DPP-4, allowing incretins to stimulate insulin release and inhibit the release of glucagon by the pancreas.

OIC-330-14-A,Which of these statements about insulin therapy is FALSE? ,"Insulin can be administered by subcutaneous injection (one to four times a day), by external pump (continuously), or sometimes in acute situations by IV injection.","The mechanisms of action of insulin are based on the stimulation of insulin receptors located on the surface of cells, which leads to an increase in glucose uptake and a decrease in its release in the liver. This mechanism is different from that of sulphonylureas (glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists) or meglitinides (glucagon-like peptide 2 receptor agonists), which act on the same receptors but with a different effect.","Insulin therapy aims to closely reproduce the physiological insulin secretion of the normal pancreas by ensuring that basal insulin levels are stable for 24 hours and that there are three insulin peaks at the time of each of the three meals. This is achieved through the administration of multiple doses throughout the day, which ensures a constant level of insulin in the blood.","Insulin therapy can be administered by subcutaneous injection (one to four times a day), by external pump (continuously), or sometimes in acute situations by IV injection.

Dietary exclusion diets are not effective. Generally speaking, dietary hygiene rules aim to combat chronic constipation. Treating chronic constipation is a common-sense measure aimed at limiting the onset of haemorrhoidal disease, preventing recurrences, and perhaps even complications. Dietary changes that help to correct stool consistency and regulate transit are recommended. Introducing a diet rich in soluble fiber (linseed, chia seeds, blond psyllium, etc.) and correcting constipation can reduce the time spent having a bowel movement and reduce dyschezia. This helps to resolve symptoms in the acute phase of haemorrhoidal attacks, prevent attacks, and treat chronic haemorrhoidal disease.","Treatment of Internal Haemorrhoidal Disease: 

Diosmin has proven efficacy in the treatment of haemorrhoidal attacks because it reduces the intensity and duration of symptoms. Local topicals include all emollient products for topical application (creams, ointments, and suppositories). They contain agents capable of reducing the inflammatory component of the haemorrhoidal crisis, acting on the oedematous component of the crisis, and promoting healing. Some topicals also have analgesic properties through local anaesthetics. Like the class of venotonics, these drugs are offered as short courses of treatment for haemorrhoidal attacks. They are not indicated in cases of chronic pathology, mainly dominated by bleeding or defecatory anal procidence.

Treatment of External Haemorrhoidal Disease: 
The only manifestation of external haemorrhoids is external haemorrhoidal thrombosis, which is treated by incision or excision. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are an alternative to incision/excision. Short courses of corticosteroids are an alternative in cases where NSAIDs and surgical treatment are contraindicated, particularly where there is a strong oedematous component.","The term ""instrumental haemorrhoid treatment"" refers to all procedures carried out to constrain the haemorrhoidal anal procidence, reinforce the supporting tissue, and form a scar at the top of the haemorrhoid. These therapeutic methods are carried out on an outpatient basis, through an anoscopy, and most often during a specialised gastroenterology consultation. These strategies constitute the basic treatment for chronic haemorrhoidal disease. They should not be carried out during a flare-up of the disease and do not represent a preventive treatment for external haemorrhoidal thrombosis. Various techniques can be used to create a chemical (sclerosis), ischaemic (elastic ligation), or thermal (infrared, bipolar coagulation, cryotherapy) eschar. The treatment is applied in a sector, in the rectal mucosa (no thermoalgesic sensitivity) above (and not on top of) the internal haemorrhoidal tissue. These methods do not remove or sclerotise the haemorrhoidal tissue itself. When the indications are well-targeted, they provide significant benefit more than three times out of four. However, their effectiveness decreases with the length of follow-up. These methods may give rise to rare complications (bleeding following the fall of an eschar, infections). Elastic ligation offers the best risk/benefit ratio but is contraindicated in patients taking anticoagulants.",Surgical haemorrhoid treatment,"The term ""instrumental haemorrhoid treatment"" refers to all procedures carried out to constrain the haemorrhoidal anal procidence, reinforce the supporting tissue, and form a scar at the top of the haemorrhoid.

- Stages I and II in cases of primary melanoma of the skin without lymph node or distant recurrence.
- Stage III in the case of locoregional, cutaneous, or lymph node involvement.
- Stage IV, in the presence of distant metastases.","The risk of regional and distant recurrence is correlated with histoprognostic parameters such as the Breslow index and ulceration.
At the stage of lymph node involvement (Stage III), the prognostic markers are the number and size of invaded lymph nodes and capsular rupture.
In Stage IV, the poor prognostic factors are a high LDH level, a large tumor mass (more than 3 organs affected by metastases; more than 3 liver metastases), and symptomatic brain metastases and/or more than 3 brain metastases.","The Breslow index is an important prognostic factor in melanoma. It measures the depth of invasion of the epidermis by the tumor, with a higher value indicating greater depth of invasion.
A high Breslow index indicates a poor prognosis for melanoma because it suggests that the tumor has invaded deeper into the dermis and may have spread to other organs.","The AJCC 8th edition is an international classification system used in oncology to classify tumors based on their stage of development.

**Title:** Know How to Diagnose a Gout Attack and Identify Situations Requiring Specialist Advice 
**Description:** Terrain, Semiology, General Signs, Comorbidities, Hyperuricaemia 
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

**Diagnosing a Gout Attack**
Gout attacks usually begin in the lower limb, particularly the foot (MTP joint of the big toe, ankle, then ascending to the knee). Attacks resolve themselves or are shortened or blocked by treatment. They recur in the absence of hypouricemic treatment with a variable frequency of weeks, months, or years. Attacks often occur closer together. At this stage of acute attacks, the joints are normal between attacks. After several years, they may affect the upper limbs. Gout rarely affects the spine, hip, or shoulder.

The diagnosis of gout is based on:
- **Background:** Men over 35, menopausal women, long-term treatment with diuretics, organ transplants; the family context must be investigated because gout has a strong genetic component (usually a polygenic disease, rare mutations in juvenile gout).
- **Nutritional Deviations:** Excessive consumption of sugary drinks rich in fructose (even ",sugar-free,soft drinks,beer with or without alcohol (rich in guanine),"strong alcohols (whisky, cognac, etc.)",option_a,4

**Description:** Evaluate the degree of urgency according to the clinical symptoms, know the principles of water restriction, and correction rules (rhythm and strategy of possible osmolar supplements).

**Rubric:** Management

**Treatment of Hyponatremia:""
- Includes aetiological treatment and symptomatic treatment, which consists of reducing excess water.
- The amount of excess water is estimated using the formula: Excess Water = 60% × weight × ([Natremia/140] - 1).

**In Chronic Hyponatremia, Priority Should Be Given to:""
- Etiological treatment (e.g., discontinuation of a drug, treatment of a cause of SIADH).
- Fluid restriction (500 mL/day) is always recommended and allows hyponatremia to be gradually corrected over several days.
- Associated symptomatic treatment, which depends on the state of the extracellular sector:
  - In the event of associated extracellular dehydration, additional NaCl intake (orally or with isotonic saline solution at 9 g/L, 0.5 to 1L/h).
  - In cases of extracellular euvolaemia due to SIADH, hyponatremia may be corrected by fluid restriction alone. If the dilution disorder is very marked (very high OsmU), fluid restriction alone may be insufficient. In this case:
    - Adding osmoles by administering urea orally (0.25 to 0.50 g/kg diluted in orange juice).
    - If these approaches fail, the use of a specific V2 ADH receptor antagonist (tolvaptan 15 to 60 mg/day orally) may be discussed if the hyponatremia is chronic and after specialist advice.
    - In cases of extracellular euvolaemia with imbalance in water intake vs. osmoles (","In a second phase, treatment reverts to that of asymptomatic hyponatremia.
- Associated hypokalaemia must be corrected (with KCl). This increases the risk of rapid correction of the natremia, particularly in patients with initial volume depletion (treatment with thiazides).

**Rate of Correction:""
- The rate of correction of hyponatremia must not exceed 10 mmol/L/day for the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L for the following 24 hours (a total of 18 mmol/L over 48 hours).

**In Emergency Cases of Severe Hyponatremia (Na < 120 mOsm/kg H2O):""
- Whether acute or chronic, and responsible for moderate to severe symptoms (consciousness disorders, comitiveness, vomiting), the following regimen may be proposed:
  - Rapid infusion of hypertonic NaCl (3% NaCl 150 mL IV over 20 min, renewable 2 times depending on the control natremia), with the initial aim of increasing the natremia by 5 mmol/L.
  - NaCl 9 ‰ (if blood volume is reduced and urinary osmolality is below 300-350 mOsm/Kg) may then be administered, with the aim of not exceeding +10 mmol/L natremia in the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L over the following 24 hours (i.e., ≤ 18 mmol/L over 48 hours) until 130 mmol/L is reached.
  - Monitoring in an intensive care unit is essential, as is the correction of any hypoxia.

**Title:** Know how to diagnose metabolic acidosis associated with renal failure, diarrhea, lactic acidosis, and ketoacidosis.

**Description:** Understand the clinical context and the diagnostic value of the plasma anion gap.

**Rubric:** Diagnostic Approach","The first step in diagnosing a patient with metabolic acidosis is to confirm that the pH is < 7.38 (or venous pH < 7.32). This is because the arterial blood pH will be higher than the venous blood pH if there is an increase in bicarbonate, which would result in a normal plasma anion gap.

The second step in diagnosing metabolic acidosis is to determine whether it is simple, mixed, or complex. A simple metabolic acidosis occurs when the PaCO2 is equal to the expected PaCO2 (i.e., there is no ventilatory compensation). In this case, the patient's arterial blood pH will be higher than their venous blood pH because of the increase in bicarbonate.

A mixed metabolic acidosis occurs when the PaCO2 is greater than the expected PaCO2. This indicates that the patient has a respiratory alkalosis and a compensatory decrease in bicarbonate to maintain a normal pH. The increased bicarbonate will result in a decreased plasma anion gap, which can be used to diagnose this type of metabolic acidosis.

A complex metabolic acidosis occurs when the PaCO2 is less than the expected PaCO2. This indicates that there is a respiratory acidosis and a compensatory increase in bicarbonate to maintain a normal pH. The increased bicarbonate will result in a decreased plasma anion gap, which can be used to diagnose this type of metabolic acidosis.

A complex metabolic acidosis occurs when the PaCO2 is less than the expected PaCO2. This indicates that there is a respiratory acidosis and a compensatory increase in bicarbonate to maintain a normal pH. The increased bicarbonate will result in a decreased plasma anion gap, which can be used to diagnose this type of metabolic acidosis.

In summary, the first step in diagnosing a patient with metabolic acidosis is to confirm that the pH is < 7.38 (or venous pH < 7.32).

Atelectasis is most often of bronchial origin, secondary to endo-luminal, mural, or extrinsic obstruction of a bronchus, usually of large diameter. It can also be passive (pulmonary collapse due to pleural effusion or ascension of the diaphragmatic dome) or due to coiling (secondary to pleural thickening).

Atelectasis of bronchial origin is manifested on chest X-ray by direct and indirect signs.
1. Direct Sign: Opacity corresponding to a retracted lung, with a reduction in volume of the affected area. This opacity is systematized with sharp edges. In lobar atelectasis, the shape of the opacity varies according to the lobe affected, but is most often triangular with a hilar apex.
2. Indirect Signs: Scissural displacement, becoming concave towards the healthy parenchyma.
3. Attraction of adjacent anatomical structures such as the trachea, heart, and hilum.
4. Ascension of the homolateral diaphragmatic dome.","Chest X-rays are frequently used to detect atelectasis of bronchial origin. A profile X-ray, in addition to a frontal X-ray, is often used to confirm and localize atelectasis.

**Educational Content:**
**Item Parent:** Nutritional needs of pregnant women 
**Title:** Knowing the expected weight gain during pregnancy 
**Description:** Based on BMI at conception 
**Rubric:** Physiopathology 

The average increase in weight during pregnancy is 13 kg. A weight gain of 1 kg per month during the first two trimesters and 500 g per week during the last trimester is considered normal.

However, the expected weight gain depends on the body type.",BMI < 18.5 kg/m²: 12.5 - 18 kg,BMI 18.5 kg/m² < BMI ≤ 25.0 kg/m²: 11.5 - 16 kg,BMI 25.0 kg/m² < BMI ≤ 30.0 kg/m²: 7 - 11.5 kg,"BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m²: 5 - 9 kg

**Correct Option:**
BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m²: 5 - 9 kg

Explanation:
The BMI of a pregnant woman is calculated by dividing her weight in kilograms by the square of her height in meters.

The average increase in weight during pregnancy is 13 kg, which means that a woman with a BMI between 18.5 and 25.0 kg/m² will gain an additional 11.5 to 16 kg during the first two trimesters and 500 g per week during the last trimester.

A woman with a BMI of 30 or more is considered obese, which means that she has a higher risk of developing complications during pregnancy and childbirth.

Therefore, it is recommended that women with a BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m² gain no more than 5 to 9 kg during the last trimester of their pregnancy.","BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m²: 5 - 9 kg

**Introduction to Medical Ethics: Genetic Testing**

Definitions

In France, under the bioethics laws, genetic testing is primarily conducted for medical or scientific research purposes. This aligns with clinical objectives and includes genetic fingerprinting for identification purposes.

Special Case: Identification by Genetic Fingerprinting

Genetic fingerprinting is used in forensic medicine to identify deceased individuals or for paternity searches. Identification is legally restricted to three contexts:
1. **Legal Proceedings**: Identification can be sought during investigations or to establish the identity of unknown deceased persons. It requires a magistrate's instruction and must be conducted in approved laboratories by registered experts. Written consent from the individual is mandatory, and posthumous identification is prohibited without prior consent.
2. **Paternity Tests**: Conducted during legal proceedings to establish or contest parentage, requiring the presumed father's consent. Tests are ordered by a judge and involve blood sample comparison and genetic fingerprinting.
3. **National Defence Code**: Used to identify deceased military personnel or those posing a security threat. Samples may be taken from frequented places or relatives, with written consent required.

Common Case: Genetic Characteristics Examination in Healthcare or Research

For medical or research purposes, written consent is required before genetic testing, with the option to revoke consent at any time. The analysis aims to:
- Diagnose genetic diseases
- Identify gene characteristics linked to diseases
- Adapt medical treatment based on genetic traits.
Examinations follow good practice rules defined by the Health Minister, including:
- Initial written consent after full information
- Option to refuse test results
- Obligation to inform family of serious genetic anomalies, with the option for the doctor to inform them anonymously

Ethical Issues in Predictive Genetics

Prediction Impact

Predictive testing can significantly affect life and liberty. It offers benefits like early monitoring for certain cancers but may have no medical benefit for untreatable diseases. Benefits include:
- Individual autonomy and decision-making
- Social and family planning

Ethical questions arise about:
- Individual autonomy and freedom
- Risk of discrimination and misuse of information

Collective Dimension of Genetic Data

Genetic information affects not just the individual but also family members. Silence on genetic risks can be seen as a loss of opportunity. Ethical dilemmas arise between individual rights and collective responsibility.
Doctors must inform patients of the risks of silence for family members in genetic disease cases, with arrangements for informing them documented.","The question is based on the following educational content, which assesses understanding of the main ideas and provides clear, informative options.

**Item Parent:** Adrenal insufficiency in adults and children 
**Title:** Knowing the Principles of the Synacthen Test 
**Description:** None 
**Rubric:** Additional Tests 

SynACTHene® (tetracosactide) is an ACTH analogue. It directly explores primary adrenal insufficiency and indirectly the possibility of corticotropic insufficiency by testing for adrenal atrophy resulting from the lack of stimulation of the adrenal cortex by ACTH.

**The Synacthen Test Consists of:**
- Cortisol measurement before the test (at 8 hours)
- IM or IV administration of a 250 µg ampoule of tetracosactide 
- Followed by a cortisol measurement at 1 hour (+/- 30 min)

**Interpretation:*
- Peak cortisol < 180 ng/ml (500 nmol/l) indicates no response to the Synacthen test, suggesting adrenal insufficiency, regardless of the aetiology.
- Cortisolemia ≥ 180 ng/ml (500 nmol/l) indicates a normal response, ruling out adrenal insufficiency except in cases of recent or partial adrenocortical insufficiency. This is because the adrenal cortex is not atrophied and can respond to a high dose of exogenous ACTH during the test (e.g., acquired corticotropic insufficiency following surgery for a pituitary adenoma, when the corticotropic axis was normal pre-operatively).

**Additional Stimulation Tests:**
- Two other stimulation tests can be conducted in a hospital setting: insulin hypoglycaemia or the Metopirone test.
If the pre-test cortisol is <5 ng/ml (138 nmol/l), the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is made without the need for a SynACTHene stimulation test. Outside a situation of major physical stress, if cortisol is >500 nmol/l, the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is ruled out, and the stimulation test is not necessary.","The peak cortisol < 180 ng/ml (500 nmol/l) indicates no response to the Synacthen test, suggesting adrenal insufficiency, regardless of the aetiology.

Outside a situation of major physical stress, if cortisol is >500 nmol/l, the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is ruled out, and the stimulation test is not necessary.","The peak cortisol < 180 ng/ml (500 nmol/l) indicates no response to the Synacthen test, suggesting adrenal insufficiency, regardless of the aetiology.
- Cortisolemia ≥ 180 ng/ml (500 nmol/l) indicates a normal response, ruling out adrenal insufficiency except in cases of recent or partial adrenocortical insufficiency.

It is slow (4-6 Hz), affects the limbs distally, the lips or chin, but never the head or voice. It is unilateral or asymmetric and is aggravated by emotions and mental calculation. This tremor is highly suggestive of Parkinson's disease, secondary to damage to the nigrostriatal pathway, but is not mandatory for diagnosis.","Trembling can be linked to other causes of parkinsonian syndrome, particularly Wilson's disease or iatrogenic parkinsonian syndrome. If Parkinson's disease is strongly suspected and the patient is over 40, no further tests are necessary. Conversely, brain MRI and a copper panel including cupraemia, ceruloplasminaemia, and 24-hour cupruria are necessary before the age of 40 to rule out Wilson's disease.","Action tremor - Present when maintaining a posture (postural tremor) and/or arriving at the target (intentional tremor). The most common cause of postural tremor is essential tremor. This is an action tremor, both postural and intentional, bilateral and symmetrical, mainly affecting the upper limbs and the head. It progresses slowly over several years and sometimes decades. It is seen when the patient writes, reproduces a spiral, maintains a posture such as stretching their hands out in front of them (the outstretched arm manoeuvre, also known as the oath manoeuvre), or bringing their index fingers together horizontally (the swordsman manoeuvre). It can be a handicap when performing everyday activities (such as eating) and can cause psychosocial embarrassment.","Cerebellar tremor - This is an action tremor that appears or is maximal upon arrival at the target (intention tremor). Its frequency is around 3 Hz. It is triggered by an intentional action (e.g., drinking a glass of water, finger-nose test). Other cerebellar symptoms may be identified: dysarthria, dyschronometric asynergy, hypotonia, cerebellar ataxia with dancing of the tendons on standing without worsening when the eyes are occluded (negative Romberg manoeuvre), and walking and balance disorders. Cerebellar gait is often identified during the assessment of the onset of walking difficulties and is characterised by a disturbance of balance with a widening of the sustentation polygon, lurching, instability, and incoordination of movements.",option_d,4
